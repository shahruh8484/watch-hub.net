            Our Mission
          </h2>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
            At Watch-Hub, we believe that finding the perfect watch shouldn't be overwhelming. Whether you're searching
            for your first timepiece or adding to an established collection, our mission is to provide clear, honest,
            and comprehensive reviews that help you make informed decisions.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
            We test and evaluate watches across all price ranges—from affordable everyday pieces to luxury
            investments—ensuring that our recommendations are based on real-world experience, not marketing hype.
          </p>

            Our Team
          </h2>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Our team consists of passionate watch enthusiasts, collectors, and industry professionals with decades of
            combined experience. Each member brings unique expertise—from vintage collecting to modern horology, from
            dive watches to dress pieces.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
            We personally test every watch we review, wearing them in real-world conditions to assess comfort,
            durability, accuracy, and overall value. Our testers include professional divers, outdoor adventurers,
            office professionals, and collectors who understand what makes a great timepiece.

            Our Standards
          </h2>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
            We maintain strict editorial independence. While we participate in the Amazon Associates program to support
            our work, our reviews are never influenced by affiliate relationships. We recommend products based solely on
            their merit, performance, and value.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Every review includes detailed specifications, high-quality photography, accuracy testing results, and
            honest assessments of both strengths and weaknesses. We believe in transparency and always disclose any
            potential conflicts of interest.
          </p>
